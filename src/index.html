<h2>
  Open standard for connecting devices to Wi-Fi using Bluetooth LE or Serial
</h2>

<p>
  Improv is a free and open standard with ready-made SDKs that offer a great
  user experience to configure Wi-Fi on devices:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Power on device</li>
  <li>
    Client application uses Improv to send the Wi-Fi credentials to the device
  </li>
  <li>The device connects to Wi-Fi network and returns a URL</li>
  <li>User visits URL to continue setting up the device</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Improv protocol can be used over Bluetooth Low Energy or via the serial port.
  Both protocols can also be used from a browser.

<h3>The problem we're solving</h3>

<p><b>Configuring a device to connect to your Wi-Fi network is a pain.</b></p>

<p>
  A lot of devices require to be connected to the network to be controlled or
  receive data. The majority of these devices use Wi-Fi to establish a
  connection with a local application or the cloud.
</p>

<p>
  The most common approach is Soft Enabled Access Point. The device starts its
  own Wi-Fi access point, the user connects to it with their phone/computer and
  then interacts directly with the device via an app or a website served from
  the device.
</p>

<p>
  It’s easy for something to go wrong. The user submits incorrect Wi-Fi
  credentials or the phone loses access to the access point. In such cases it is
  difficult to recover. Phones also have a bad time dealing with access points
  that don’t provide internet access.
</p>

<h3>Scope & Constraints</h3>
<p>
  The goal of the Improv standard is to get the device connected to the Wi-Fi
  via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Serial (USB/UART). It is not the goal to
  offer a way for devices to share data or control. The standard should work
  without requiring the device to contain a screen.
</p>
