<h2>Open standard for Wi-Fi provisioning via Bluetooth LE</h2>

<div style="background-color: #ffe185; border-radius: 8px; padding: 4px 8px">
  Improv is still under construction. Please don't talk about it in public.
</div>

<p>
  Improv is a free and open standard with ready-made SDKs that offer a great
  user experience to configure Wi-Fi on devices.
</p>
<p>
  With Improv creators can offer a better onboarding experience when they share
  their creations with others:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connect gadget to power.</li>
  <li>
    Client application uses Improv to send the Wi-Fi credentials to the gadget.
  </li>
  <li>The gadget will connect to the wireless network and returns a URL.</li>
  <li>
    Client application guides user to the URL to continue setting up the gadget.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Improv provisioning also works in browsers that support WebBluetooth.

<h3>The problem we're solving</h3>

<p>
  Getting your Wi-Fi gadget connected to the internet is a bad user experience.
</p>

<p>
  A lot of devices offer APIs to be controlled or receive data via TCP/IP. The
  majority of these devices use Wi-Fi to establish a connection with the cloud
  or a local application.
</p>

<p>
  Configuring a device to connect to your Wi-Fi is a pain. The most common
  approach is Soft Enabled Access Point. The device starts its own Wi-Fi access
  point, the user connects to it with their phone/computer and then interacts
  directly with the device via an app or a website served from the device.
</p>

<p>
  It’s easy for something to go wrong. The user submits incorrect Wi-Fi
  credentials or the phone loses access to the access point. In such cases it is
  difficult to recover. Phones also have a bad time dealing with access points
  that don’t provide internet access.
</p>

<h3>Scope and constraints</h3>
<p>
  The goal of the standard is to get the device connected to the Wi-Fi via
  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is not the goal to offer a way for devices to
  share data or control. The standard should work without requiring the device
  to contain a screen.
